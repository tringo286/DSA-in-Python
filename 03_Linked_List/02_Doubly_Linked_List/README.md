# Doubly Linked List

## Introduction

A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure where each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.

## Features

- Insert elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Delete elements by value or position.
- Traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.
- Search for an element.
- Update an element.

## Operations

- **Insert**: Add elements at the beginning, end, or at a given position.
- **Delete**: Remove elements by value or position.
- **Traverse**: Go through the list in both directions.
- **Search**: Find an element in the list.
- **Update**: Change an element in the list.
