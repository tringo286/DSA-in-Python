# Description:
# Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x, find whether element x is present in the array. Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesnâ€™t exist.

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.

# Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and its not present, so we return -1.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
def search (arr, x):
    for i in arr:
        if i == x:
            return i
    return -1


arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
x = 3
result = search(arr, x) # The element is present at index 2
if result == - 1:
    print("The element is not in the array")
else:
    print("The element is present at index", result)
