# Introduction to Strings

# Strings are sequences of characters. The differences between a character array and a string are, a string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’ and strings are typically immutable in most of the programming languages like Java, Python and JavaScript. Below are some examples of strings:

# "geeks" , "for", "geeks", "GeeksforGeeks", "Geeks for Geeks", "123Geeks", "@123 Geeks"

# How to Declare Strings in Python

# Python: Strings are dynamic and can be declared using single, double, or triple quotes, making them flexible for multi-line text handling.

String1 = '''I'm a Geek and I live in a world of "Geeks"'''

String1 = '''Geeks
