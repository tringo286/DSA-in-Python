# Longest substring between any pair of occurrences ≈çf similar characters

# Given a string s, your task is to determine the length of the longest substring that lies between two identical characters in the string. The substring should exclude the characters at the two ends. If no such pair of identical characters exists, return -1.

# Examples:

# Input: s = "accabbacc"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The matching characters are 'c' at positions 1 and 8. Substring between them is "cabbac", of length 6.

# Input: s = "aa"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Matching characters 'a' are at positions 0 and 1. No characters in between, so length is 0.

# Input: s = "abcd"
# Output: -1
# Explanation: No repeated characters exist, hence no valid substring between same characters.

# 1. [Brute-Force Approach] Generate and Check All Substrings - O(n^2) Time and O(1) Space

# The idea is to brute-force check every possible pair of characters in the string. We iterate through all indices (i, j) where s[i] == s[j], and compute the length of the substring between them. The goal is to track the maximum length found. This approach works because we are guaranteed to consider all valid pairs due to the nested loop.

# Python program to find the length of the longest 
# substring between two identical characters 
# using Brute-Force Approach

# Function to return the length of the longest valid substring
def longestSubstring(s):

    n = len(s)
    maxLen = -1

    # Check all pairs (i, j) where s[i] == s[j]
    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(i + 1, n):

            # If matching characters found
            if s[i] == s[j]:

                # Update maximum length
                maxLen = max(maxLen, j - i - 1)

    return maxLen

    s = "accabbacc"
