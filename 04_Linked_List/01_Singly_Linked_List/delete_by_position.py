# delete_by_position.py

# 1. Check for empty list: If the linked list is empty, there's nothing to delete.

# 2. Check if the position is valid: Ensure that the position is within the range of the list (i.e., not negative and less than the size of the list).

# 3 .Delete the node at the position:

    # If the position is 0 (head node), adjust the head to the next node.

    # Otherwise, traverse the list to find the node just before the node to be deleted. Adjust the previous nodeâ€™s next pointer to skip the node to be deleted, effectively removing it from the list.
