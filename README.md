# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python** repository! This is where I document my learning process as I explore the essential concepts of DSA in Python. The goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, and to understand their time complexities using **Big O notation**.

## Whatâ€™s Included

This repository will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Big O Notation**: Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- **Arrays**: Exploring basic operations like searching, insertion, and deletion.
- **Linked Lists**: A more flexible data structure compared to arrays.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Fundamental structures for specific algorithmic patterns.
- **Trees**: Understanding binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, and tree traversals.
- **Graphs**: Learning about graph representations and traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implementing and analyzing common algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and binary search.
- **Recursion**: Understanding the power of recursive solutions and how to break down problems.

## Repo Structure

The repository will be structured to reflect a natural progression through these topics. Each section will contain:
- **Theory**: An explanation of the data structure or algorithm, its purpose, and its applications.
- **Code**: Python implementations of the data structures and algorithms.
- **Examples**: Real-world examples or problems where the concepts can be applied.
- **Complexity Analysis**: A breakdown of the time and space complexity of the algorithms.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I aim to:
- Build a deeper understanding of DSA concepts.
- Implement data structures and algorithms from scratch in Python.
- Improve my ability to analyze and optimize the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Solve increasingly difficult problems and challenges.
